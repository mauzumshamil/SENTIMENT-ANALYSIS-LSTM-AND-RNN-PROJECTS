# SENTIMENT-ANALYSIS-LSTM-AND-RNN-PROJECTS
Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) are powerful deep learning architectures used for sequential data processing. Both LSTM and RNN models excel in tasks such as time series prediction, natural language processing, and sequence generation. 
They are capable of capturing temporal dependencies in data, making them suitable for applications requiring memory of past information.

Specific Project Descriptions:

Sentiment Analysis with LSTM:

Description: This project involves training an LSTM model to perform sentiment analysis on movie reviews. The LSTM network will learn to classify movie reviews as positive, negative, or neutral based on the sentiment expressed in the text. The model will be trained on a dataset containing labeled movie reviews, and its performance will be evaluated using metrics such as accuracy and F1-score.
Stock Price Prediction with RNN:

Description: In this project, you'll use a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) to predict stock prices. You'll train the RNN model on historical stock price data and use it to forecast future stock prices. The RNN will learn to capture patterns and trends in the stock market data, enabling it to make predictions with reasonable accuracy. The project will involve preprocessing the data, designing the RNN architecture, training the model, and evaluating its performance using metrics like mean squared error.
